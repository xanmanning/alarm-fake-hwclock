alarm-fake-hwclock
==================

**Written by Xan Manning** inspired by `fake-hwclock` by Steve McIntyre

Save/restore system clock on machines without working RTC hardware.

Dead simple C program initially designed for Arch Linux ARM that works like fake-hwclock on Debian.

See https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/fake-hwclock-git/ for a package in the ArchLinux AUR.


Installation
------------

Requires `CMake` to build. Suggested packages: `ntp` and `cron`.

	CMake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .
	make
	make install


To set system time on start up and save system time on halt, enable the systemd service:

	systemctl enable fake-hwclock.service


To keep `fake-hwclock` up to date in case of power failure, install and enable `ntp` and add the following job to your root `crontab` (`sudo crontab -e`):

	*/15 * * * * /usr/bin/fake-hwclock
